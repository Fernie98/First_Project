# First Project

This will be my first attempt at working with audio recognition.

The goal of this small program is to be able to listen to key words and perform certain actions at the detection of such words.

Using Beautiful Soup to access yahoo images and wget to download desired images
and google speech api to listen and select desired search results will download images 
to local device as specified on scrape_download.py
